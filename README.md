# Lyrics-Generator
A Deep Learning based approach to generate song lyrics of famous artists.

We use LSTM and Bidirectional LSTM to generate lyrics just like the artist whose dataset we choose.

# Dataset
We will use the dataset: [Taylor Swift Song Lyrics from all the albums](https://www.kaggle.com/PromptCloudHQ/taylor-swift-song-lyrics-from-all-the-albums) from Kaggle.

And will try to generate new lines of lyrics with a few words as a jumpstart.

# Future Vision

This is a very basic approach to start with, we can add more data to increase the prediction quality. Moreover, we can use some different architecture and work more intensively as well.

I did this project as a 'Weekend Skills Brush-up". I will be trying to push this ahead someday later.

Feel free to reproduce and make it better. Also, do let me know about it.
